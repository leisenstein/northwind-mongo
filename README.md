## Northwind@MongoDB ##

### What it is

* Just a simple data dump from SQL's Northwind database to a CSV
* CSV (northwind.csv) turned into multiple CSVs
* CSVs imported into Mongo (mongo-import.sh)


### What it needs

* There aren't any employee/product images
* It's a straight data dump - no relations or special magic


Thanks to [@shayden](https://github.com/shayden) for the csv dump. Buyer beware, caveat emptor, carthago delenda est et al
